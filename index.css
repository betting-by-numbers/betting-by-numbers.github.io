/**
index.css

NOTE: This file does ~~not~~ contain Tailwind CSS class definitions.
- Documentation can be found here: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/aspect-ratio (left side bar contains more stuff to look through!)
- TLDR: Tailwind classes can be represented by this structure -> [CLASS]-[SUBCLASS (opt.)]-[STRENGTH (scales of 100]
    - This means that "bg-gray-800" translates to CSS as "background: #(hex value of dark gray)"
    - Similarly, "p-8" translates to CSS as "padding: 32px"
- Please feel free to use Tailwind if it benefits you, but I will do my best to minimize the use of Tailwind in shared
  code components to ensure that we all can contribute as needed! Ping me if you need anything at all in regards to Tailwind,
  it is a very powerful CSS tool to have once you build your CSS fundamentals!
- TLDR: If you do not find a class listed in index.html in this file, it is a Tailwind class!

/*
 @media tags 
 
 Media tags allow us to customize CSS based on the device viewing our site! These tags allow for conditional styling,
 making the viewing difference -responsive- across mobile and larger device screens. When activated, they overwrite
 parameters of the original class with new values, but parameters that are not specified will REMAIN their original value!

 NOTE: Media tags function as an overwrite to the original class' parameters. Generally, these media tags are structured
 to update for devices <greater than or equal to> the designated width threshold. For this reason, responsive design styles
 from the smallest device first, and gradually adjusts itself to fit wider screens!
