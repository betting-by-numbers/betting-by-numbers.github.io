# About
Betting By Numbers was a final project created in Stanford's COMM177T - Building News Apps, in Winter 2025 by Carlo, Hannah, and Hawe. The final website, A Sports Betting Story, is a news application site that covers the rise of sports-betting in America over the past few years. We tell this story in a data-driven approach, showing the sports-betting industry's impact by the hard numbers aloneâ€”-but also highlight the very real, human impacts this industry has on American citizens.
