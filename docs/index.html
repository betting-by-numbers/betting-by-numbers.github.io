    <p class="text-lg text-white text-center font-raleway-500">In the years following the 2018 Supreme Court decision to overturn the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_and_Amateur_Sports_Protection_Act_of_1992" class="hover:text-gray-500"> Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA)</a>, sports betting has transformed from a largely prohibited activity into a mainstream industry across the United States. This landmark ruling granted individual states the authority to legalize and regulate sports wagering, leading to rapid and widespread adoption.</p>
    <p class="text-lg text-white text-center font-raleway-500 pt-6">As of March 2025, sports betting is legal in 38 states and the District of Columbia, with 30 of these jurisdictions also permitting online wagering. This expansion has been accompanied by a significant increase in betting activity. In 2023, Americans legally wagered over $115 billion on sports, marking a substantial rise from previous years. </p>

    <p class="text-lg text-white text-center font-raleway-500 pt-6">2023 data from St. Bonaventure and Siena Research indicate that nearly four in ten Americans bet on sporting events and one in five have an online account with a sports betting service such as DraftKings, Caesars, or FanDuel. Those with online accounts tend to be younger and less educated and are more likely to be male and from the south.</p>

      The data also show that men are more confident than women in their betting outcomes. For those with a sports betting account who have placed a bet, men are more likely than women to say that they win more than they lose on their bets. The following question was asked to respondents that actively sportsbet:

        <p class="text-white text-center font-raleway-500 py-3 pb-8 lg:pb-3">The data in the chart show that, among those who actively sportsbet, men more often claimed that they had "won more than they lost" in betting, while women more often claimed that they had "broken even".</p>

    <p class="text-lg text-white text-center font-raleway-500 pt-6">
      Further, most sports bettors win modest amounts when they land their bets. Nearly sixty percent of survey respondents said their biggest single-day win on an online sportsbook was under $200, while only 8% reported winning $1,000 or more. The following question was asked to respondents that actively sportsbet:

        <p class="text-white text-center font-raleway-500 py-3 pb-8 lg:pb-3">The data shows that big wins tend to be modest in size. Nearly 60% of big winners only reported a win value of under $200. It is rare to hit it big on a single sportsbet, with only 8% winning over $1000.</p>

    <p class="text-lg text-white text-center font-raleway-500 pt-6">
      The rapid growth of sports betting has raised concerns about gambling addiction. Research published in JAMA Internal Medicine indicates that sports gambling wagers surged from $4.9 billion in 2017 to $121 billion in 2023, leading to a 23% rise in online searches for gambling addiction help.

                    and online sportsbooks advertising made sports betting nearly impossible to avoid—and then one day, he caved in.

Like clockwork, Holt under bet international women’s basketball games and saw the money come in. In one weekend, Holt won $1000. The income led him to dreams of home renovations and surprising his family with football tickets. All losses were outweighed by his consistent winning bets—he felt unstoppable…</p>

                  <p class="text-gray-400 text-sm">…until the bets dried up. The stream of wins quickly morphed into landslide losses. Efforts to double future bets to cover previous losses did not save Holt. $100 losses were followed by $200 losses—Holt even lost $1000 in a single  day in a failed bet. Holt’s dreams of football tickets and home renovations were quickly replaced with digging himself out of this hole.</p>

He just needed a bet to stick. Mortgages, auto loans, and vast sums of money were taken from the banks into his sports betting app. The losses were huge—$5,000... $10,000... and soon, Holt found himself $50,000 in the red.</p>
