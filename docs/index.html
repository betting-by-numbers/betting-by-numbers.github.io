    <p class="text-lg text-white text-center font-raleway-500">Revenue from legalized sports betting has surged in recent years, driven by a 2018 Supreme Court ruling that overturned the  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_and_Amateur_Sports_Protection_Act_of_1992" class="hover:text-gray-500"> Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA). </a>The decision allowed individual states to legalize and regulate sports wagering, transforming what was once a largely prohibited activity into a booming industry.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg text-white text-center font-raleway-500 pt-6">As of March 2025, sports betting is legal in 38 states and the District of Columbia, with 30 of these jurisdictions also permitting online wagering. In 2023, Americans legally wagered nearly $14 billion on sports, according to the American Gaming Association.</p>

       Nearly sixty percent of survey respondents said their biggest single-day win on an online sportsbook was under $200. 
       It is rare to hit it big on a single sportsbet, with only 8% winning over $1000.  The following question was asked to respondents that actively sportsbet:
